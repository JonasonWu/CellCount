* Run applications in the following order:
    * python load_data.py
    * python initial_analysis.py
    * python statistical_analysis.py
    * python subset_analysis.py

## Method 2: Using Terminal
* Open the terminal.
* Navigate to the directory of this project.
* Run python scripts in following order:
    * python load_data.py

# Files
## load_data.py
* Uses the data from the cell-count.csv and creates the cell_counts.db database.
## initial_analysis.py
* Answers the question: What is the frequency of each cell type in each sample?
* Displays a summary table of the relative frequency of each cell population into relative_frequency.txt.
## statistical_analysis.py
* Not completed.
## subset_analysis.py
* Performs an analysis of PBMC samples at baseline. Prints out the results on the terminal.
